###Comments

* This is an example of a medication which is QID and PRN (as needed) but with no precondition specified. It was generated based on SDWG list-serv discussion in December 2013. It also demonstrated a pre-coordinated generic medication coded at the SDC level (generic 600mg Oral Tablet) in RxNorm hierarchy.
